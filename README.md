## Things you need to do:
NFT Marketplace
Project Description
The NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform built on Core Testnet 2 that allows users to mint, list, and purchase Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This marketplace facilitates seamless transactions between creators and collectors while maintaining security, transparency, and ease of use.
Project Vision
Our vision is to create an accessible and user-friendly NFT marketplace that empowers artists, creators, and collectors to participate in the growing NFT ecosystem. By building on Core Testnet 2, we aim to provide a cost-effective and efficient platform for NFT transactions with lower gas fees and faster confirmation times.
Key Features

NFT Minting: Users can create their own NFTs by providing metadata and tokenURI.
NFT Listing: NFT owners can list their tokens for sale at their desired price.
NFT Buying: Users can purchase listed NFTs directly through the marketplace.
Fee Structure: A sustainable marketplace fee system (currently 2%) to support platform development.

Future Scope

Bidding System: Implement auction functionality for NFTs.
Collection Management: Allow creators to group NFTs into collections.
Royalties: Support for secondary sales royalties for original creators.
Cross-Chain Support: Expand to support multiple blockchains beyond Core Testnet.
Advanced Search and Filtering: Enhance discoverability with better search options.
Mobile Application: Develop dedicated mobile apps for better user experience.
Integration with Social Media: Allow sharing and promoting NFTs on social platforms.
